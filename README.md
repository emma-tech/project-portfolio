# Portfolio ‚ú®
Welcome to my portfolio with inspiration, articles and a collection of my latest projects in frontend development. The portfolio was built during week 8 of the Technigo bootcamp, and will be updated weekly during the bootcamp with new projects. 

# About the project üë©‚Äçüíª

A lot of effort in this project was put in responsive design and accessibility. I've used Wave, Lighthouse and W3C's validators for HTML and CSS in this project to check for errors and issues with performance, accessibility and validation. The code is validating without errors, and after fixing some issues with image sizes and color contrast I received the following points from the Lighthouse audit: 

- Desktop: Performance: 84, Accessibility: 94, Best Practices: 93, SEO: 90.

- Mobile: Performance: 85, Accessibility: 94, Best Practices: 93, SEO: 92.
